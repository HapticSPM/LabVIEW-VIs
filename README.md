# LabView-VI
## Feedback
Feedback mode is the when the haptic device only controls the x/y position of the STM tip. It reads some value from Nanonis and applies a corresponding force.
### Feedback - Demod
Reads demodulated channel, can feel electron waves.
### Feedback - Height
Reads the z position, can feel surface features.
## Feedbackless/Raw
Feedbackless/raw mode is when the haptic device controls the STM tip in all 3 dimensions, and experiences a force depending on the tunneling current.

One VI reads data from a file and the other reads directly from Nanonis.
